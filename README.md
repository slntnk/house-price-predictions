# House Price Prediction

This project focuses on predicting house prices using **Python**. Various machine learning algorithms have been implemented to compare their performance in regression tasks.

## Algorithms Used
- Multiple Linear Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest

## Objective
The main goal of this project is to predict house prices based on their features and evaluate the performance of different machine learning models.

## Dataset
The dataset is obtained from Kaggle's **[House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques)** competition. It contains detailed information about house features and their respective prices.
